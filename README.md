            #TOY PROBLEM PHASE 1

        ##CHALLENGE 1
The first challenge is a grade generator.Takes a number input*(marks) and outputs a grade based on the output.
         ###Funcionality
How the grade is generated from the inputed marks is very simple a function with nested if is defined in the studentgradegenerator.js file.The name of the function is result()
when a user inputs a certain number between 0-100 and clicks on the generate button the result() function is called and the corresponding grade is indicated on the console.

        ###structure
A form was created to enable user to insert the input number that they want to be graded in the index.html file
The form also contains a button with the name generate which has a function on it that when clicked invokes the function and displays the grade on the console

The js file contains two variables and a function; The first variable holds the value of the input 
                                                   The second variable holds the value of the form and the event listener.
                                                   The function is called result() and is what generates the grade from the inputed value.
